# SEO Implementation Overview

This document outlines the various Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategies and features implemented across the ShareVault website. The implementation leverages Next.js 14+ features for metadata management, structured data, and crawlability.

## 1. Metadata Management

Dynamic and static metadata is managed sitewide to ensure optimal representation in search engine results pages (SERPs).

### 1.1. Global Metadata

- **Location**: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Description**: Sets the default metadata for all pages. This includes:
  - **Title**: A default title and a template (`%s`) for page-specific titles.
  - **Description**: A default meta description for the site.
  - **Keywords**: Default keywords relevant to the entire site.
  - **Open Graph & Twitter Cards**: Default images, titles, and descriptions for social media sharing.
  - **Canonical URL**: A base canonical URL for the entire site, generated via `getCanonicalUrl()` from `src/lib/seo-utils.ts`.
  - **Verification**: Includes tags for Google Search Console verification.

### 1.2. Dynamic Page-Level Metadata

- **Location**: `src/app/[slug]/page.tsx` (and other page components)
- **Description**: Each blog post generates its own unique metadata using the `generateMetadata` function. This includes:
  - **Unique Title**: The title of the blog post.
  - **Unique Description**: The post's excerpt is used as the meta description.
  - **Keywords**: The post's tags are used as keywords.
  - **Author Information**: The author's name is included in the metadata.
  - **Detailed Open Graph & Twitter Cards**: Specific titles, descriptions, and images for each post to ensure rich social media previews.
  - **Canonical URL**: A unique canonical URL is generated for each post to prevent duplicate content issues.

## 2. Structured Data (Schema Markup)

JSON-LD is used extensively to provide search engines with detailed, structured information about the content.

### 2.1. Site-Wide Schemas

- **Location**: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Description**: The root layout injects two main schemas on all pages:
  - `Organization`: Describes the "ShareVault" organization, including its name, logo, and contact information.
  - `WebSite`: Includes the site's name, URL, and enables a Sitelinks Search Box feature in SERPs.

### 2.2. Page-Specific Schemas

- **Location**: `src/app/[slug]/page.tsx`
- **Description**: Blog post pages include highly detailed schemas:
  - `BlogPosting`: A comprehensive schema detailing the article's headline, author, publisher, publication/modification dates, images, and more.
  - `BreadcrumbList`: Provides a breadcrumb trail for easy navigation and improved SERP appearance.
  - `Person`: A dedicated schema for the article's author, generated by the `PersonSchema` component.

### 2.3. Reusable Schema Components

- **Location**: `src/components/`
- **Description**: A suite of reusable React components has been created to easily inject various types of structured data where needed:
  - `FAQSchema.tsx`: For pages containing Frequently Asked Questions.
  - `HowToSchema.tsx`: For step-by-step guides and tutorials.
  - `PersonSchema.tsx`: For author pages or mentions.
  - `ReviewSchema.tsx`: For content that includes reviews.

## 3. Indexing & Crawlability

Control over how search engines crawl and index the site is managed through `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.

### 3.1. Robots.txt

- **Location**: `src/app/robots.ts`
- **Description**: A `robots.txt` file is dynamically generated to instruct search engine crawlers.
  - It allows full access to the site for all user agents.
  - It explicitly disallows crawling of the `/admin/` directory to keep backend pages out of the index.
  - It provides a direct link to the `sitemap.xml` file.

### 3.2. Sitemap.xml

- **Location**: `src/app/sitemap.ts`
- **Description**: A `sitemap.xml` is dynamically generated to ensure all relevant pages are discovered by search engines.
  - It includes all static pages (e.g., home, about, privacy policy).
  - It dynamically fetches all blog posts from the database and adds them to the sitemap.
  - It specifies `lastModified`, `changeFrequency`, and `priority` for each URL to provide crawlers with additional hints.

## 4. Content & Syndication

### 4.1. RSS Feed

- **Location**: `src/app/api/rss/route.ts` (handler) and `src/app/layout.tsx` (link tag)
- **Description**: An RSS feed is available at `/api/rss`. A link to this feed is included in the `<head>` of all pages, allowing users and services to subscribe to new content updates.

## 5. Web App & PWA Features

### 5.1. Web App Manifest

- **Location**: `src/app/manifest.ts`
- **Description**: The site includes a `manifest.json` file, making it a Progressive Web App (PWA). This allows users to "install" the website on their devices and improves the mobile experience. The manifest defines the app's name, icons, theme colors, and start URL.
