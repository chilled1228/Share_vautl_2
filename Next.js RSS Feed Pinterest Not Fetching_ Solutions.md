## Next.js RSS Feed Pinterest Not Fetching: Solutions and Troubleshooting

Based on comprehensive research, the issue of Next.js RSS feeds not being fetched by Pinterest appears to stem from several interconnected problems involving both Pinterest's policy changes and technical implementation issues.

### **Pinterest RSS Auto-Publishing Feature Discontinued**

The most significant factor affecting RSS feed integration with Pinterest is that **Pinterest has largely discontinued or severely limited its RSS autopublish feature**. Multiple users have reported that Pinterest's RSS feed functionality stopped working in recent years:[^1][^2][^3]

- Pinterest's bulk create pins (auto-publish from RSS) feature has been experiencing persistent issues, with users reporting errors like "Something went wrong on our end" when trying to set up RSS feeds[^3]
- The Pinterest service is no longer available on automation platforms like IFTTT, with existing connections potentially still functioning but no new connections being allowed[^2]
- Users have reported that RSS feeds to Pinterest stopped working, with some noting temporary resumptions but overall unreliability[^1]


### **Technical Issues with Next.js RSS Feed Generation**

When building RSS feeds in Next.js applications that were intended for Pinterest integration, several technical challenges commonly occur:

**Server-Side Rendering Problems**

- RSS feeds must be generated server-side since they need to be static XML files accessible to external services[^4]
- Next.js applications using client-side only rendering cannot generate proper RSS feeds that Pinterest can access[^4]
- Issues with `getServerSideProps` not working properly in production environments can prevent RSS feeds from being generated correctly[^5]

**CORS and Network Issues**

- Pinterest may block or fail to fetch RSS feeds due to CORS restrictions or network connectivity issues
- RSS feed validation problems, such as XML parsing errors or improper formatting, can prevent Pinterest from reading the feed[^6]


### **Current Workarounds and Solutions**

**Alternative Pinterest Integration Methods**

1. **Manual Pin Creation**: Instead of relying on RSS feeds, manually create and schedule pins using Pinterest's native tools or third-party social media management platforms
2. **Pinterest RSS Feed Extraction**: Use Pinterest's own RSS feeds (formatted as `https://www.pinterest.com/USERNAME/BOARDNAME.rss`) for content consumption rather than trying to push content to Pinterest[^7][^8]
3. **Third-Party Tools**: Consider using specialized Pinterest automation tools that don't rely on RSS feeds but use Pinterest's API directly[^9]

**Next.js RSS Feed Implementation Best Practices**
For generating proper RSS feeds in Next.js:

```javascript
// Example RSS generation in Next.js API route
export default function handler(req, res) {
  const rssItems = posts.map(post => `
    <item>
      <title>${post.title}</title>
      <link>${post.url}</link>
      <description>${post.description}</description>
      <pubDate>${post.date}</pubDate>
    </item>
  `).join('');

  const rss = `
    <rss version="2.0">
      <channel>
        <title>Your Blog</title>
        <link>https://yourdomain.com</link>
        <description>Your blog description</description>
        ${rssItems}
      </channel>
    </rss>
  `;

  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/xml');
  res.write(rss);
  res.end();
}
```

**RSS Feed Validation and Testing**

- Ensure RSS feeds validate properly using online XML validators[^6]
- Test RSS feeds with multiple feed readers before attempting Pinterest integration
- Check that RSS feeds are accessible via direct URL and properly formatted[^10]


### **Current Status and Recommendations**

Given Pinterest's discontinuation of reliable RSS feed integration, the most practical approach for Next.js developers is to:[^3][^1]

1. **Focus on Manual Pinterest Strategy**: Create high-quality pins manually and use Pinterest's native scheduling tools
2. **Maintain RSS Feeds for Other Purposes**: Continue generating RSS feeds for legitimate subscribers and other platforms that still support RSS integration
3. **Monitor Pinterest Updates**: Keep track of Pinterest's developer documentation for any restoration of RSS feed functionality
4. **Consider Alternative Platforms**: Explore other visual platforms that still support RSS feed integration for automated content distribution

The widespread reports of Pinterest RSS feed issues, combined with the platform's apparent policy changes regarding automated content ingestion, suggest that this is primarily a Pinterest-side limitation rather than a Next.js implementation problem.[^11][^2][^3]
